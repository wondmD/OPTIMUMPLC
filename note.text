Logistics & Cargo Moving
Sea • Air • Land
Modern logistics is about choosing the right mode for the right moment. We teach your team how to synchronize routing with cost-efficiency across Ethiopia's vital gateways.
    • Routing & Mode Strategy
    • Coordinating with the Port to ensure your cargo never sits idle at a border.
    • Mastering the handover process from the Customs Release Note to final Proof-of-Delivery (POD) and audit-ready reconciliation.

Import/Export Mandatory Documents & Concepts
Compliance • Accuracy • Speed
The document is often more important than the goods. In Ethiopia, a single missing stamp or incorrect HS Code can result in weeks of storage fees. This track builds the technical foundation your team needs to avoid rejections.
    • The Document Stack Anatomy
    • Who Prepares What:


International Trade & Basic Terms
Incoterms • HS • Documentation
This is our "Back to Basics" technical track, essential for ensuring that every member of your team understands the language of global trade.
    • A deep dive into the cost and risk split between buyer and seller (FOB, CIF, EXW, etc.) so you never pay more than you should.
    • We teach the logic of HS Code alignment, helping you classify goods to ensure accurate tariffing and zero customs fines.
    • A hands-on workshop on the Ethiopian Customs "Golden Set":
        ◦ Commercial Invoice: Verification by Chambers of Commerce.
        ◦ Packing List (PL): Strategic layout for inspection ease.
        ◦ Certificate of Origin (COO): Navigating bilateral trade benefits.
        ◦ BL/AWB: Managing original sets vs. digital releases.

Single Window & Online Trade Apps
Accounts • Roles • Clean Data
The Ethiopia Electronic Single Window (ESW) is now the mandatory gateway for all trade. We ensure your digital submission is "Right First Time."
    • Configuring user roles (Trader, Declarant, LPCO) to ensure secure and authorized system access.
    • Using standardized templates to capture mandatory fields, drastically reducing "Rejection" rates.
    • Actively monitoring the digital workflow across Bank, Insurance, and Customs approvals for a clean handover.


Investment & Marketing

Foreign investors can now enter retail, wholesale, and export/import sectors. We help you navigate this new landscape to build a profitable, compliant presence.
    • We guide you through the Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC) permit process 
    • Defining your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) in the Ethiopian market and selecting the right digital and physical channels for high engagement.

Entrepreneurship & Business Thinking
Mindset • Models • Execution
In an evolving economy, the difference between a project and a profitable business is the mindset. This track helps you move from "merely running a business" to building a scalable, growth-oriented enterprise.
    • Business Models & Market Fit
    • Agility & Risk Control
    • The Scale Path
Motivational Speaking & Communication
Inspire • Align • Mobilize
Leadership in trade requires the ability to unite diverse stakeholders—suppliers, banks, and regulators—behind a single vision. We help you turn facts into stories that move people.
    • We use the "Rule of Three" and the "Start Strong, End Strong" method to ensure your message is memorable and clear.
    • Master the "Power Pose" even in high-pressure board meetings.
    • We help you design closings that don't just "end" the speech, but mobilize the audience to take the next concrete step.

HR Systems & Leadership
SOPs • KPIs • Coaching
In the "outcome-based" Ethiopian TVET system, success is measured by competence. We help you build HR systems where every employee knows exactly how to win.
    • We define clear expectations using Occupational Standards (OS) so performance is measurable and fair.
    • We document your "World of Work" workflows, ensuring consistency whether you are in Addis or at the port.
    • We coach managers in "feedback that sticks," moving away from top-down orders toward high-impact mentorship.
Customer Ethics
Trust • Fairness • Service
Based on the Professional Ethics and Civic Virtues curriculum, we teach that integrity is the foundation of competitive advantage in Ethiopia.
    • Training on transparency, accountability, and the "unity of thought, word, and deed" in client interactions.
    • Systems to capture real customer feedback and turn it into actionable service improvements.
Kaizen Philosophy
Small Wins • Weekly Flow
As the strategic change tool chosen by the Ethiopian government, Kaizen is about more than just cleaning—it is about the "mindset for action."
    • We teach your team to spot the "7 Deadly Wastes," from over-processing paperwork to unnecessary transportation.
    • Establishing a "Plan-Do-Check-Act" rhythm with weekly stand-ups and retrospectives.
    • Empowering the staff to suggest and scale their own operational improvements.
